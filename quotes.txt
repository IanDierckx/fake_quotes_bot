"I had a nightmare."
"To breath or not to breath, that is the question."
"Nah."
"Is that a monkey?"
"I'm on the alley to heaven."
"I see dead people."
"Time to get dirty."
"Welcome to the old world."
"I don't feel like getting dressed."
"No time like the past."
"What am I doing here?"
"Let's get wasted."
"Hey, do you play D&D?"
"There's dead people here and rats and shit."
"Want to see something cool?"
"I scream for ice cream."
"Let's get this party started."
"That's fucked up."
"Why are people staring at me?"
"I miss my mama."
"See mom, no hands."
"I swear I'm not crazy!"
"You sure you want to do this?"
"Shit."
